<h3 id="transformation-in-one-generation">Transformation in one generation</h3>

<p>The first half of the twentieth century was a difficult period for Korea. The country was under Japanese occupation and took part in several wars, the last one being the Korean War from 1950-1953 that took place after the division of Korea into North- and South Korea. </p>

<p>The Korean War left South Korea ravaged, and in the following decade the South Korean economic growth was low, corruption was high and government spending focused on restoring the country. In 1957 the Korean income per capita was lower than that of Ghana.</p>

<p>The turning point came in the 1960s, when the country was industrialized and modernized. This was achieved by focusing on South Korea’s most significant resource, labor. The country shifted to an exporting economy centered on labor-intensive manufactured products. The manufacturing sector became a competitive advantage for South Korea, surpassing neighboring countries in 
economic growth rate. During the period from 1960 to 1990 the South Korean economy was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with an average yearly economic growth of 10 percent. Although the high growth was desirable, it led to problems for the country. Since the growth originated in industries that were mainly located in the larger cities, income differences increased between these cities and the rural areas which were left poor and underdeveloped. This was compensated for by the government through several investment projects in the rural areas. </p>

<p>As South Korea became wealthier, salaries increased and the manufacturing industry struggled to compete internationally with continuingly low prices. This caused a shift in the South Korean economy. In 1990 South Korean manufacturers had a meeting together with politicians and business leaders to discuss different strategies to deal with the issue. The result was a focus on 
high-tech industries, a field where South Korea is one of the leading actors in the world as of today. </p>

<p>The growth is still ongoing in the 21st century where Korea displays one of the highest growth rates in Asia, together with Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. What makes this significant is that South Korea hardly has any natural resources. Despite this, South Korea is the sixth largest exporting country in the world. It is the only developed country in the world that is being part of the Next Eleven countries, a list consisting of the eleven countries with highest economic potential in the forthcoming century. </p>

<p>As of 2014 the South Korean GDP is number 15 in the world and the economy is number 12 in purchasing power, making it one of the wealthiest countries in the world. It was one of the few countries in the world that was hardly affected during the recent global financial crisis. The economic growth during the crisis was reduced due to declining exports; however, the unemployment rate stayed low, averaging around 2-3 percent during the period. </p>

<p>This remarkable economic development is somewhat unique for Korea, although other Asian countries also display high growth. This raises the topic of how Korea could develop so rapidly and relatively smoothly in such a short period of time. The development has gained widespread attention worldwide and several attempts have been made to identify the key factors behind the growth - how a nation with barely any natural resources could undergo such a transformation in such a short period of time. </p>

<p>The recurring factors in literature about the South Korean economic growth are the national education system and the culture. The culture in South Korea is in many aspects similar to that of neighboring countries, China and Japan ‒ countries that have displayed similar growth during the twentieth century. Researchers argue that the Asian working mentality and the pride affiliated with working is one of the main reasons behind the development in these countries. This alone does not constitute the answer since there are several Asian countries with similar culture and characteristics as China, South Korea and Japan which do not show the same economic development. The second reason discussed is the importance of the South Korean education system. In South Korea education is seen as an essential requirement for social and financial success, resulting in a large proportion of government expenditure being spent on education to make the education system modern and high-tech. This has yielded in South Korea developing the first digital textbooks, which are distributed for free to every primary and secondary school in the nation via high-speed fiber optic broadband. The investments in national education have paid off, problem solving, mathematics and science. </p>

<p>Although it is impossible to distinguish one unique factor as the key behind South Koreas success, it rather makes the development more interesting. The home of gigantic corporations such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG has more than one success story to share with the rest of the world, and are more than willing to do so.</p>
