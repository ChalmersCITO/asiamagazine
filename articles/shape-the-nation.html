<p><em>A reflection on the effects of disciplinary hierarchy in the Singaporean educational culture.</em></p>

<p>I am waiting for the bus to take me to University Town, my home during the year. The bus is uncharacteristically late and I realize I am getting frustrated. Another bus passes and I manage to read two quotes sprawled across the vehicle: “Of all the careers that lies ahead, take one that makes a difference.” I assume that I am seeing an ad for a university or a specific program; however, underneath this, in capital letters, I depict: “SHAPE THE NATION”. This is the government of Singapore reaching out to its future workforce and I realize that this is what the nation is about ‒ individuals striving to contribute to the prosperity of the country. </p>

<p>This is founded in the fact that Singaporeans have a strong group mentality, displayed everywhere you move in the city: shopping with friends, eating dinner at a hawker center, playing games in the park or helping a tourist. For me, the strong group mentality really surface in the work of the studio. That is where I, as an architect student, spend most of my time. At my home university we have lectures, full days of working on your own project and private meetings with a tutor once a week. In Singapore, the schedule is characterized by lectures scattered over the week and sometimes full days of classes. In addition to this there are two to four hour studio sessions, twice a week; however, they often turn out to be six to eight hours of discussions. The reason for this is that the discussion is always carried out in a full group. 
The leader of these studio sessions is naturally the professor or tutor for the studio. After having presented our project, which we do formally once or twice a week, my group will listen and comment on the work of other groups. At Chalmers this would only occur during final presentations and midterm reviews. The idea is that you learn by listening to and understanding the work of others, and that you help each other as a group to establish the fundamental features for the project.</p>

<p>This way of working gives insight in other people’s processes and ideas, and you do learn a great deal by trying to solve problems in other projects. However, I kept asking myself: why it is that these students were willing to do two or more hours of overtime every session whereas in Sweden, students would storm out after 30 minutes with or without a legitimate excuse? The answer is discipline. I believe that the great level of discipline that you find in Singapore is closely related to respect for authority. </p>

<p>You do not question the authority of the professor upfront, something that I as an exchange student had difficulties to understand. I wanted to announce loudly that we were running late and that I needed to go to the pool or do homework or just be somewhere else. I had many frustrated discussions with my professor during the first weeks, balancing on a delicate line towards arguments. I struggled to accept this level of authority watching my fellow students fall asleep while trying to take notes, due to late hours working on submissions requested by the professor. Many times the submissions are announced on a short notice but nevertheless with expected high quality of work. As I am only here for a year I do not have a previous or future relation with my tutors, allowing me to be a bit more distanced to their impact of authority. I also have friends from other faculties forcing me out of the studio. This unfamiliar hierarchal system fascinated me, but mostly frustrated me before I understood the level of interest and engagement the tutor had in the work of the group. </p>

<p>After a couple of weeks our tutor took the initiative to start a WatsApp group with the whole studio, as well as with the individual groups. Initially I found this as an intrusive gesture and did not want him to be a part of my life outside of the classroom. However, as he showed a never ending interest in our project, constantly giving feedback and sharing new ideas, he eventually became a natural part of the group and his attentive nature impressed me. </p>

<p>The relationship between the students and the professor has an interesting nature by being both formal and informal. The authority of the professor prevents the students from being completely honest with their ideas, requiring their flexibility and acceptance of a tutor that can have demanding ideas and work forms. On the other hand, the tutors tend to be involved in the work of the students to a greater extent than I have ever experienced, creating a sense of informality and close connection. </p>

<p>The work in the studio shows a great will to help members of the group to reach the common goal. There is a friendly atmosphere regarding sharing of ideas and work that I have not encountered in the work as an architect student previously. I believe that one reason for this attitude towards the individual’s work is that in the end it is beneficial for the whole group. That is, the common goal of making an interesting and substantial project ‒ and this cannot be done without sharing ideas and helping each other. I believe that the same way of working applies to a great deal of areas and activities in the Singaporean nation and culture, being one of the reasons behind its success and prosperity as a nation. </p>

<p>Being from Sweden, where a lot of our work and actions is beneficial purely on an individual level, it is interesting to see this level of cooperation. I still find it frustrating not being able to express differing views to my professor without being worried about my final grade. However, I believe that discipline and respect is a great contributor to the level of quality our final project will have. In relation to this, discipline and great respect for the authority creates a nation that functions peacefully and efficiently despite, or thanks to the great varieties of ethnicity and religion. I find this mindset of working as a group inspiring and an important part of the Singaporean culture.</p>
