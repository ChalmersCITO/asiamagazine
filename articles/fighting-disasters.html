<h3 id="tzu-chi--a-future-place-for-you-as-an-engineer">Tzu Chi – a future place for you as an engineer?</h3>

<p>One of Asia’s largest non-governmental organisations, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, has its base of operation in Hualien at Taiwan’s east coast. Its work is to provide relief during disasters – both man-made and natural – and was started in 1966, by the now 73 year old Dharma Master Cheng Yen in the aftermath of the American aid programme coming to an end. Starting out as a monastery for nuns it has since evolved alongside Taiwan’s economic miracle into an organisation with 2 million volunteers worldwide, and an annual income from donations of more than 269 million USD (2006 figure). With this in mind it is not strange that Master Cheng Yen qualified as one of the world’s most influential people according to TIME­ magazine in 2011. However successful, with continuous development the organization is constantly facing new challenges – many of them having an engineering or academic nature.</p>

<p>We arrive to Hualien by train early in the morning. On the station we’re met by the warm air of Taiwan’s east coast. After taking a cab a couple of kilometres we can immediately spot the venue where we are going to conduct the interview – Jing­ Si hall is a massive building with distinct temple-­like features. Finding our way to the lobby we are surprised to be met by two rows of employees, one with men and one with women, lined up right beyond the entrance. It soon turns out that the staff is expecting the arrival of the Dharma Master at any minute, and they want to greet her with respect. She is coming down from her abode to conduct a speech for the volunteers that are currently in training in this venue.</p>

<p>Although the arrival of the grandmaster indeed lives up to many of our prejudices about religious organizations, our interviewee Chad Liu, public relations responsible at the Tzu Chi headquarters, presents us with a different perspective. He explains that the Buddhist part plays a minor role in the work that is done. As an example he tells us that anyone is welcome to join as a volunteer, regardless of religious beliefs. Chad himself has worked in the organization for 19 years; as a catholic he is living proof that Tzu Chi puts little emphasis on the religious background of its members. Also, he points out, the organisation is strictly unilateral in its work, doing no missionary work nor conversion in the process of helping. Having said this, we are directed to sit down in the hall’s bookshop and café that is filled with toddlers and teenagers helping to serve coffee and tea. We sit down and turn to our first couple of questions regarding the core values of Tzu Chi.</p>

<p>“Disasters are man­-made”, Chad states in a calm voice. “We have a collective responsibility to prevent them from happening”. The three of us reflect on this seemingly interesting view for a couple of minutes. During this summer, Taiwan has experienced two traumatic events. The first – a gas explosion in Kaohsiung – cost 27 people their lives and caused almost 300 injuries. The second – a plane crash on Penghu Island – cost 48 people their lives. Neither is hard to blame on individual or collective mistakes. However, Chad mentions that natural disasters also should be incorporated in this collective responsibility. When he sees that we don’t understand his meaning he elaborates and explains that the meaning of this statement is rather a question about definitions. What is considered a disaster is not only the event itself – for example a typhoon or an earthquake – but more importantly, the fact that people suffer. Here people can do a lot to prevent other people’s suffering at any catastrophic event.</p>

<p>This seems to be the philosophy of Tzu Chi; disasters are caused by people not intervening against bad things happening and prevented by people who do. Therefore they seek to intervene. As an engineer you have a chance to play a big role in this mission, Chad tells us. During the 2010 floods in Pakistan one Tzu Chi engineer named Marshall Siao started developing a low portable bed. The construction allowed refugees to sleep comfortably a few inches over the waterlogged ground. With continued improvement the low plastic bed was developed into a multi-purpose folding platform that was awarded the prestigious Red Dot Design Award in 2014. The design goes above and beyond, using food grade Polypropylene for the construction to ensure the bed will not irritate even a baby’s skin.</p>

<p>The will to not only restore status quo in disaster areas but also improve the situation, is a goal that has had huge effect on the organization’s success in China. For 25 years, in the wake of floods and earthquakes, Tzu Chi has been in China, building schools in rural areas. When Sichuan was struck by a devastating earthquake in 2008, many schools built by the local government were destroyed, taking the lives of thousands of children. But all the Tzu Chi schools remained; the Tzu Chi in-house construction division promoted the use use of a different kind of reinforced concrete – not as cheap, but much more sturdy. This adherence to long-term solutions coupled with a strict non-political agenda has opened up relations with China. In 2010 Tzu Chi was the first and only foreign NGO in China allowed to set up a nationwide charity foundation.</p>

<p>We are told about other engineering problems encountered by the organization. Chad explains the importance of designing aid-equipment in a durable and sustainable way. Two examples come to mind. The first is the challenge of designing prefab houses, like those currently used in Indonesia for restoration after the typhoon Yolanda. The houses have to be designed in such a way that they provide better cover and standard of living than a tent, while at the same time being non-permanent and modular so that they can be disassembled and reused at a different location. Further improvement of the structures are still being sought and those with viable ideas have an opportunity to contribute. The second example mentioned is that of providing portable methods to purify water while minimizing residual, non-renewable bi-products. For this task the organisation has sub-contracted a Taiwanese firm driven by a local entrepreneur. The firm produces water filtration equipment made from recycled plastic bottles. The product is too cheap to be commercially viable but fits the organization's philosophy well. Thus, Tzu Chi pays the company a price high enough for it to continue its operation. In this case the engineer behind the company can make a difference while still making a living.  </p>

<p>We’re coming to the end of the interview as we start to discuss the future. “Looking forward we face even bigger challenges” Chad states. Elaborating that the changing climate and increasing urbanisation will give us more and bigger disasters. We all must be ready to act, and we need new solutions in order to avert future disasters. One message is clear: As engineering students you have the chance to play a future role in improving the work of this organisation, independent of your own definition of the word <em>disaster</em>.</p>
