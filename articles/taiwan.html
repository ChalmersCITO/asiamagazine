<p>When we first told people that we were going to Taiwan, we got a lot of puzzled looks. Many didn’t know very much, or in some cases nothing at all, about the place. There were grandparents who were quite certain it was somewhere in China and friends who only remembered the Made in Taiwan stamp from childhood. First of all, Taiwan is not the same thing as China and it has definitely more to offer than just plastic toys. </p>

<p>About half of Taiwan’s area consists of a great mountain range. The mountains in the central and east part of the island are steep and covered with jungle. Hence, most of the population lives in big cities by the coastline. The western part of Taiwan is the most urbanized region and when travelling from the north to the south it feels like you’re just going through one large continuous city. This is the part of Taiwan, the industrial and technological hotspot, that some western people are aware of and associate the country with. However, this view of Taiwan doesn’t provide the whole picture. After being here for some months we have come to realise that Taiwan is much underestimated by most people in the west. In this article we aim to give a brief picture of our experiences of this beautiful island.</p>

<p>In the north of Taiwan lies Taipei, the capital of Taiwan and home to the world’s second highest building, Taipei 101. From having been scarred by both the Japanese rule in the first half of the 1900s and of the martial law during the second half, Taipei has recently started to flourish. The city core is modern with lots of fashionable clothing stores, nightclubs and the majestic skyscraper dominating the view. Closer to the riverside, the city instead spreads out in narrow streets packed with people and shops. During the evening the activity gets even more intense with a lot of the streets transforming into night markets where one can find different examples of Asian cuisine as well as miscellaneous clothes, accessories and other trinkets.   </p>

<p>The food culture is one of the best parts of life in Taiwan. There are restaurants everywhere and the food is so cheap that you never cook by yourselves. Eating is a big part of how you socialize with friends and the traditional way of enjoying a meal, where everyone share dishes, is great for exploring different tastes together. As Taiwan has such a diverse population, with people emigrated from many different parts of China and the rest of Asia, there is a large supply of different styles and dishes. </p>

<p>When the Chinese government fled from the communists to Taiwan, they brought a lot of old treasures from the Forbidden City in Beijing with them. The artefacts spans more than 10 000 years of Chinese history and was mainly collected by China’s ancient emperors. Since 1965 the collection is for display at the National Palace Museum in Taipei and is well worth a visit.</p>

<p>Just one hour southwest from Taipei lies a town called Hsinchu, or new bamboo, which is where we live. It’s an industrial city almost the same size as Gothenburg. A lot of microconductor companies are based here and Asus, Acer and Benq all have roots in Hsinchu. The city is also home to two famous universities, NCTU and NTHU. Together with National Taiwan University in Taipei, these three are the most prestigious in Taiwan. </p>

<p>The city looks like most smaller Taiwanese cities we've been to. It consists mostly of endless streets lined with flashing neon signs, scooter workshops, restaurants and various small stores. There are hardly any sidewalks and if they exist, they’re already full of scooters or cars. It is hard to go anywhere by foot; instead, everyone drives a scooter. Old people drive fully loaded with large boxes of food, guys with girls clinging on their backs, and families with kids standing between the parent’s legs on the cargo space. The entire road system is built with driving scooters in mind. When 23 million people are huddled at the western edge of a country as large as Denmark, there is no space for everyone to have a car. </p>

<p>The middle and eastern part of Taiwan is mountainous. Sometimes considered East Asia’s highest peak – depending on how you define East Asia – Yushan, or Jade Mountain, rises 3952 m above sea level right in the middle of Taiwan. There are also several large national parks with lots of hiking trails along and up the steep mountainsides. One of the most famous national parks is Taroko gorge. We spent a day walking along the huge gorge that the river had created over thousands of years. Just east of this national park, by the foot of the mountain lies the coastline. Here you can find a lot of beaches with great waves for surfing – which we would have liked to say we tried successfully but that wouldn’t be entirely true. </p>

<p>Further down to the south lies Kenting, a place with great opportunities for snorkeling and scuba diving. Unfortunately we went there during an incoming typhoon, so all of the beaches were closed to the public. The beaches looked really nice though and Kenting is a place we are sure to revisit. </p>

<p>One of the most distinguishing features of Taiwan is its people. The Taiwanese are remarkably friendly and always very keen to help confused and strayed foreigners. The only problem though is that most Taiwanese, especially in the rural areas, don’t speak much English. Instead we get to practice our non-existing Chinese and our only slightly better body language. Eventually everything tends to work out fine despite the language barriers, much because of the Taiwanese’s helpful attitudes. It also provides a more colourful experience.</p>

<p>This is just a brief flash of what Taiwan has to offer. We have only been here for a couple of months, and we still have much left to do and explore – climbing Yushan is among the things on the top of that list. There is so much more to say about Taiwan; we haven’t written about the mysterious religious traditions, the colourful aboriginal people or the peculiar bubble milk tea. That is all up to you to experience.</p>
