<p>“There are no kids in Singapore”. This, a friend of mine told me when we were talking about the fact that I just had been admitted for exchange studies at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. He confidently explained that the reason behind this is that everyone living there are focused on accelerating their career, and does not have time for raising children. When arriving after an 18-hour flight, jet lagged and underfed since the last nine dishes consisted of airplane food, I was deeply disturbed by a platoon of crying children ‒ my friend had been wrong.</p>

<p>Singapore is, however, one of the world’s major commercial hubs. The multicultural and highly populated island country on the tip of the Malay Peninsula is the fourth biggest financial centre, and one of the five busiest ports in the world. With its advantageous geographical location, there are also excellent travel opportunities. For the weekend, one must choose between surfing at the beaches of Bali, trekking on Borneo or perhaps celebrating Saturday night in a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur. The short distance to some of Southeast Asia’s most beautiful places, in combination with the flourishing financial atmosphere, makes Singapore a very attractive workplace. </p>

<p>The first time I came in personal contact with the financial world of Singapore, was when opening a local bank account at the Singapore branch of the Swedish bank Handelsbanken. Arriving at 65th Chulia Street, after navigating between skyscrapers and food courts, I found the office at the 21st floor of the 50-floor building. Still not used to the intensive heat and humidity, wearing shorts and t-shirt, I was feeling extremely underdressed standing in the high-speed elevator in the middle of suits in different shades of dark colours.</p>

<p>When entering the relatively small bank office, it was a pleasant surprise to meet another Swede. Charlotta Pedersen, or as she calls herself, Lottis, welcomed us warmly and asked us to sit down in one of the meeting rooms. Not yet really used to Singlish (the Singaporean accent of English), the relief to be able to carry out banking transactions in my own native language could hardly be described. Also, my new acquaintance was kind enough to let me interview her about her experience of living and working in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Could you tell me some things about your background; your education and how you started working at Handelsbanken?</strong><br />
<em>I have got a degree in Business Law &amp; EU-law from the University of Sussex, England. I started working at Handelsbanken early on during high school and got the opportunity to keep working there during university studies. Consequently, it felt natural to continue within Handelsbanken, where I have been working since 1998.</em></p>

<p><strong>Why did you move to Singapore?</strong><br />
<em>I appreciate the opportunity to broaden the horizons within the concern. For instance, I have been working in London as well as New York on behalf of Handelsbanken. Also, living in Asia during a limited period had been a long-term plan for me; Singapore was suitable for that purpose.</em></p>

<p><strong>What is the biggest difference between working in Sweden and working abroad?</strong><br />
<em>There is mostly no specific difference, but the fact that Handelsbanken is not that known outside Sweden requires the employees to explain to customers how the firm is conducting banking more than usually. I reckon this is quite different from home where the bank could be found in (almost) each and every street corner.</em></p>

<p><strong>Are there any specific advantages of working abroad?</strong><br />
<em>There are too many to tell. One benefit from leaving the comfort zone is that you grow as a person and therefore as an employee. I cannot think about any specific disadvantages, but I have to clarify that one has to cherish relations with friends in the home country. “Prepare for returning home as soon as you get there”, I once heard, meaning that one should not underestimate how distance affects relations.</em></p>

<p><strong>How do you cure possible homesickness?</strong><br />
<em>I would say that Skype and telephone calls are important tools to cure it. Also, going to IKEA could solve missing the Swedish cuisine, since they offer their famous ‘Swedish Meatballs’ as well as Swedish candy worldwide.</em></p>

<p><strong>Will you keep working abroad in the future?</strong><br />
<em>Yes, that it is very likely. Handelsbanken is growing a lot in Great Britain which, in combination with the fact that my husband is British, seems quite suitable as a long-term plan.</em></p>

<p>As for me, working in Singapore in the future does not seem that far-fetched. Since I enjoy living here, I may be able to get used to working here too, even though I might not be able to raise any children due to lack of time.
Anyway, when leaving Singapore, it will not be a goodbye ‒ it will be a <em>see you later…</em></p>
