<p>I think that most of us believe that the purpose of going abroad is about embracing new cultures, discover new things, and broaden your horizons. That’s exactly what I thought my trip was going to be like ‒ I was wrong. I’ve always made fun of people travelling to places where there are more Swedes than natives; a trip with all-inclusive, where you are being served continental breakfast and buffet with European food. I understood that the goal with those trips was to relax and get away from everyday life, but I thought that I was different. The sad truth is, however, that my behavior is just the same. That became very clear during my first days in Beijing.</p>

<p>My stay started with one goal – to get myself a cup of coffee. After a long search I finally found a place, three kilometers from my dormitory. When I ordered they asked me if I wanted the coffee hot or cold. Of course I want it hot, what a stupid question, I thought to myself. I drank my hot coffee and continued settling down on campus.</p>

<p>The second day me and some other students went to a bar street outside campus. They served cold beer, played western music and had a pool table ‒ we had the time of our lives. On the way home we found Subway and I ate my first western meal in China. This became my best experience in China so far. </p>

<p>The third day I met a Chinese girl studying journalism. We started talking about the Chinese government and how they’re controlling the history books, media and the internet. She told me that she didn´t like it, but that it wasn´t that big of a problem since you just don’t trust everything that´s written. We left it there and I thought to myself that this girl has to be brainwashed, even though I knew she was brighter than me. Afterwards we went together to the only burger place on campus, at my request.</p>

<p>The fourth day I got a fever. Presumably because of all the Chinese impressions and the fact that I missed the trip to IKEA that all the other exchange students did. I went to comfort myself at the only restaurant that served pizza.</p>

<p>What I realized after a while was that everywhere I went I was looking for people with the same opinion as me, for the same food I usually eat, and for places that looks like I´m used to. And all the time I looked at the unfamiliar things as something strange; is that really embracing the culture? I think the fact that we think of our own culture as superior can explain why it´s so hard to adapt to another culture. Even though the intention is to be a part of it, your own culture and habits are building barriers for that adaption to happen. </p>

<p>On campus you can also see that people tend to group themselves together just because they have one thing in common ‒ nationality. Everywhere I go I´m meeting groups of Germans speaking their mother tongue. They group together in order to not get eaten by the big Chinese culture. You could say that the campus in this university works a lot like the suburbs in bigger cities with special restaurants and cafés for foreign students. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that the biggest reason people group together isn´t reasons like personalities, interests or social status. It´s the sense of security they get when they meet someone from their own culture, with the assumption that they are alike. Therefore I´m glad I haven´t met Swedes yet, since I probably would be in the same situation as the Germans. So if I really want to embrace another culture I probably will have to force myself to do things even though it makes me uncomfortable ‒ and see the differences as something fascinating. </p>

<p>Looking at my desperate search for Western culture I have to admit one thing; the only difference between me and people traveling with all-inclusive, is that they already know that they want what’s known, and I´m living in some kind of illusion that I want to change and embrace other cultures. So whether it´s me trying to live like a Chinese, or if it´s someone trying to adapt to the Swedish culture – our habits and culture will probably make it difficult to get all the way. So even though I thought I was going to become a bit Chinese, I have to realize that I´m still a Swede, and I certainly haven´t been trying to change that ‒ yet.</p>
