        <h1 id="homeless-in-tokyo">Homeless in Tokyo</h1>

<p>That it’s difficult to find affordable housing in Tokyo is, I would say, a platitude and the reality is more relative to what you’re used to. Coming from Gothenburg, I find homes in Tokyo reasonably priced, however small they may be. Available apartments are abundant, so expats moving in shouldn’t feel overly concerned about difficulties of finding housing. Even so, there can be a lot of reasons why one would like to have immediate short- or medium-term budget options. Salarymen with homes far away from the city looking for places to sleep during the weeks seem to be very commmon. Add to the mix travelers, people thrown out in the cold by their significant other, and plain homeless people and you have a viable market for short-term residence. Personally, I came to Tokyo three weeks prior to my apartment moving-in date and found that the arrangements I had made were not valid anymore. </p>

<p>Fear not, because there are several alternatives. Below, I outline the ones I loooked into. Save for hostels, all of the alternatives below offer per-hour prices if you don’t want to stay the entire night.</p>

<h2 id="hostel">Hostel</h2>
<p>Not that different from backpackers’ lodges and hostels worldwide.
Cost: From about 2200 yen per bed per night.</p>

<h2 id="staying-at-someone-elses-place">Staying at someone elses place</h2>
<p>Can be the best or the worst, depending on you and the person you’re staying with. Be aware that Japanese people generally don’t invite people over in the same way that western people might be used to; some feel a great deal of integrity about their home.</p>

<h2 id="manga-caf">Manga café</h2>
<p>Generally, you can find at least one close to almost every subway station. It’s basically like an Internet café, but with tons of manga books and a private booth with a sofa and a gaming computer. Most have reasonably priced food and many even have showers. It’s not too comfortable and the lights stay on throughout the night.
Cost: About 2000 yen per night</p>

<h2 id="capsule-hotel">Capsule hotel</h2>
<p>Not as abundant as the manga cafes, but can be found in the central areas like Ueno and Shinjuku. They’re similar to big hostels, but you get your own private cell (super comfy as long as you’re shorter than about 185 cm) and the other guests are generally old unsociable Japanese men rather than chatty foreign backpackers. Capsule hotels usually come with a bathing/sauna space to freshen up after a hard day’s work.
Cost: About 2500/3000 yen per night. 3900 for the futuristic, Star Trek Enterprise-feeling 9h establishment at Narita Airport.</p>

<h2 id="urban-camping">Urban camping</h2>
<p>Homeless people in Japan are not like homeless people anywhere else I’ve been. They keep to themselves, build small shelters of cardboard boxes and I have never seen anyone beg. The pride and shame in Japanese culture is obvious here as much as anywhere. In Japan, there is no allemansrätt. Still, propping up a tent in a small park or similar should be no problem as long as you don’t bother anyone, stay out of the way, and clean up after yourself. Japan is also generally a very safe place. This is the only alternative I didn’t try, mainly because all the camping gear I could find in stores was a bit on the expensive side to be worth it for such a short time. Proper preparation is key here; Tokyo summer is going to be hell and the winter might be a bit cold, but spring and fall should be good. Obviously you want to stay aware of the occasional typhoons.
Cost: From free to whatever you want to spend on gear.</p>

<h2 id="love-hotel">Love hotel</h2>
<p>As I initially said, people generally don’t invite each other home in Tokyo. So what you do when you find the love of the night at an intoxicated night out in sparkling Kabukicho or Roppongi, is to head to one of these installments. Pricey (expect about 8000 yen) if you just want to have a good night’s sleep on your own on a weekend. Find someone to share it with for some hours and it doesn’t have to be that expensive, though.
Cost: Varies greatly</p>

<p>All in all, there are a lot of different ways to be creative about getting some shut-eye and freshen up in a city like Tokyo. Sleeping at a sauna, in karaoke boxes, at rental offices, or even at McDonald’s is not unheard of. Just be sure to use your creativity, be prepared, have a backup plan if it doesn’t work out like expected, and stay safe!</p>
