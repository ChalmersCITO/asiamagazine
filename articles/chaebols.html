<h2 id="the-elephant-conglomerates-of-south-korea">The elephant conglomerates of South Korea</h2>

<p>The South Korean economy is dominated by huge business conglomerates called chaebols. The chaebols (재벌) are typically family-controlled with the families of the major chaebols being extremely wealthy and having huge influence and power in Korea. The Samsung family group is the biggest chaebol with assets of 325 billion USD. Other important chaebols are the family groups Hyundai and LG. Sales from the top ten chaebols equal 80 percent of the Korean economy and the four biggest (Samsung, Hyundai Motors, LG and SK) accounts for 30 percent alone.</p>

<h3 id="history--from-noodles-to-galaxy-s5">History – From noodles to Galaxy S5</h3>
<p>Several of the chaebols spring from Korean companies that obtained assets from Japanese firms as the 35 year long Japanese occupation of Korea ended with the Second World War in 1945. Many of these companies had close links to the government of the First Republic, lasting between 1948 and 1960. The companies were accused of being received special treatment from the government and for wide spread corruption. After the military seized power in 1961 with the aim to eradicate corruption and industrialize the country, the government gave some of the major companies massive contracts and guaranteed foreign loans. Following the earlier accusations of corruption, many of the leaders from the big companies were charged with corruption, but since the government’s major industrialization plans could not be fulfilled without these companies, the leaders got away with vast fines. Even though the military took actions against corruption the chaebols continued to be deeply connected to the government and corruption was widely spread. In 1987 Korea adopted democracy and as a chaebol leader became president, the deep connections between government and the chaebols continued.</p>

<p>Korea early implemented a policy know as guided-capitalism which helped the chaebols to move with the times into new and more advanced industries. The chaebols moved from consumer goods into heavy industry and onwards into high-tech electronics. The transformation and expansion into new businesses has been crucial for the development of the chaebols. One Samsung boss once said that you should be willing to change everything except your wife and children. </p>

<h3 id="growing-criticism-and-scandals">Growing criticism and scandals</h3>
<p>Since 1990 the heads of seven of the ten biggest chaebols have been convicted for bribery, tax-evasion or embezzlement. Even though the court found them guilty, the government could not allow the powerful leaders to go to jail because of the impact it would have on the economy. Therefore all seven of them got a presidential pardon and returned to management positions within the chaebols. In 2008, Lee Kun-Hee, Chairman of Samsung Group and the wealthiest man in Korea with a net worth of 11.6 billion USD, was found guilty of bribery and fined 100 million USD. He was later given a presidential pardon.</p>

<p>The chaebols are accused of suppressing entrepreneurship due to the difficulties of taking on chaebol subsidiaries. Because of the overwhelming positions the chaebols possess and how deeply they are entwined in the Korean society, students are encouraged to work there instead of starting their own businesses. The chaebols are also accused of putting smaller companies and local street-sellers out of business; this has led to an increasing public anti-chaebol movement that has forced the government to take actions to suppress the chaebols’ dominating position. To save local businesses, the chaebols are prohibited by law from entering many different industries, including making tofu, bottles, toys, soap and sunglasses. 
Further criticism regard the poor working conditions; the workers in South Korea have the longest working hours of all developed countries, working 70 days more per year than the average Swedish worker. The long working hours and the extreme pressure on students is believed to be the reason behind Korea having the second highest suicide rating in the world. Students study on averaged 14 hours a day and two percent of Koreas GDP is spent on private tutors after school.</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>The growing anti-chaebol community and politicians put increasing pressure on the chaebols. Laws against cross-ownership are discussed to begin to dismantle the chaebols. The importance of innovation and entrepreneurship with new small businesses is of increasing value, shifting the economy from being based on high academic grades, political connections and special treatment towards individuals’ merit and value in the market.
One problem the families running the conglomerates face, is keeping the power over the chaebols. The total number of shares held by the controlling family is usually very low, around two percent, but through advanced networks with cross-ownership they keep control over the chaebols. One delicate issue arises when it’s time to pass on the control from one family member to another, something Samsung is about to do in the near future. The inheritance tax in the Samsung case is believed to exceed six billion USD, which might force the family to sell shares to free cash – and by doing so, lose some control over the company.</p>

<h3 id="your-future-employer">Your future employer?</h3>
<p>Even though the chaebols have dominated the Korean economy for a long time they have previously not attracted students from Korean top universities for executive positions, much because the chaebols focus on manufacturing. Students from the more prestigious programs have historically aimed for a career at banks, consulting firms or law. This is about change as the percentage of students from Seoul National University, often referred to as Koreas Harvard, that went to work at a chaebol have increased drastically in just a few years. Samsung electronics is the exception that has attracted students for a long time, but the rising star among the major companies is Hyundai Motors which is the fastest growing global automobile company. Hyundai Motors is now the biggest employer of business grads from SNU. The reasons behind this change are primarily that the chaebol jobs provide the opportunity to travel, competitive salary and job security. The chaebols are also changing their way of recruiting from just waiting for students to apply, towards more advanced head-hunting to find students with more attractive background. A previous problem within the chaebols has been the company culture, where young executives were forced to work long hours and pushed to stay after work for heavy drinking all night with co-workers.</p>
