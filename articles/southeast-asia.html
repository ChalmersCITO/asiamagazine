<p>Singapore – smaller Asia at its finest. Although young, at only 49 years old, Singapore reflects an inspired growth from the western world, with its international atmosphere and bustling streets. Five million people from all over the world reside here where the businesses are flourishing. Known as a key hub, for global companies to do business, Singapore is ranked number one for investment potentials and location. </p>

<p>The location is also a huge reason as to why students choose Singapore for their exchange studies. When I first moved here, about two months ago, this was set to be my first time in Southeast Asia. With limited ideas of what to expect, I came knowing that people eat a lot of chicken and rice, and that my 180 cm would make me taller than most.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed when I arrived was, of course, the overwhelming heat and humidity, which was exotic for a freezing Swede. But to adapt to the life here was actually not as hard as it looked. The public transport system is extremely efficient and there are plenty of surveillance cameras everywhere, making you feel safe and secure at any time of the day. My Singaporean friends actually think that I’m quite fussy when I don’t want to leave my computer and iPad alone when we go for coffee. The truth is that you can actually feel secure and protected at most places around the city. </p>

<p>Singapore is a country of law and order; there are exhortations and warnings everywhere stating what you should and should not do. For example, it’s forbidden to eat and drink on the subway or even chew gum, and if you are caught doing so it will result in high fines. Once used to the everyday life in Singapore, you almost want to provoke this by opening your water bottle on the metro train, just to see what happens and how your fellow passengers react. Fortunately, the neighbouring countries just steps away are not so strict with their laws. </p>

<p>One of the best things that Singapore has to offer is its fantastic location. It is one of the most important harbours in the world with lots of opportunities and easy access to the rest of Asia, through flight or ferry. Only a couple of hours away you reach countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These countries have a lot of things in common, not just the friendly Asian welcome you receive wherever you go, but also that people are very helpful, despite the often huge language barrier. </p>

<p>By ferry you can reach several islands in Malaysia and Indonesia; one of the closest is Indonesian Bintan, where I took a cab across the countryside and got to see how gas is refilled by hand.</p>

<p>In Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, the well-organized subway has gone and has been replaced by bubbling chaos, with more mopeds than cars and non-existing traffic rules.  Every time a street is crossed it feels like a “YOLO”- moment. It’s fascinating to just stand by the street and watch all random things people pack on their vehicles: stairs, furniture, bananas or a whole family of five. </p>

<p>When crossing the border to Cambodia you quickly realize that it’s a country under construction – the infrastructure is extremely bad and the expression “bumpy ride” gets a totally new dimension. The streets are dirty and garbage disposals are almost non-existing. Cambodia is most famous for the Angkor Wat temples, but even though tourism is up and coming, Cambodia is still one of the world’s poorest countries. During the Pol Pot regime in the late ‘70s, two million people were killed here, many of whom were very well educated. The country is still suffering from its past, not just emotionally; only a quarter of the population was born before that era and the country has therefore a remarkably young population. Even though they have horrible memories in mind, a smiling face always greets you.  </p>

<p>It is a real privilege to get the opportunity to travel Asia, to discover new cultures, meet new people and to see things from others perspective. Often things do not turn out as you expect, but entirely different and amazing in their own unique way. This charm is what makes the experiences abroad extraordinary, and I have to confess that Asia is so much more than just chicken and rice; however, as a tall Swede, you do get a lot of attention. </p>
