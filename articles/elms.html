<p><em>Social English the fun way</em></p>

<p>As the City University of Hong Kong celebrates its 30th year around, pennants and festive decorations surround us when we meet up at the University Circle in the middle of campus. Kirk, Antony, Jayden and I have gathered here quite a number of times now during the past few weeks. We are all part of ELMS, short for English Language Mentoring Scheme, which is an initiative that aims to help 1st and 2nd year students improve their English communication skills in various social settings. It is also a great platform for cultural exchanges and increased understanding between borders. With that said, ELMS constitutes an interesting concept that I am proud to be part of.</p>

<p>ELMS is a program based on voluntary grounds. ELC, the English Language Centre at CityU, invites Western exchange students and students with English as their mother tongue to join the scheme as mentors. Each mentor is responsible for a group of a maximum of seven students in total; students have applied for this program as an optional activity outside their regular school schedule. One hour, once every week, this group devises activities based on interests and initiatives by its own members. The goal is to create relaxed settings and opportunities for everyone to practice English in different social contexts. Such group activities could range from having lunch, playing sports, sightseeing, cooking, playing board games or just hanging out in a park discussing school assignments or the latest updates in The Premier League. </p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that ELMS activities are not English lessons, but a fun way of providing Chinese and Hong Kong born students the opportunity to communicate in English outside of the classroom. Active participation should enable each participant to interact in a variety of situations. So far, Kirk, Antony, Jayden and I have dined together and played various sports. Today, we are going to the movies!</p>

<p>ELMS is not the only initiative taken by the ELC. Since the unit’s establishment in 1997, its deliberate mission has been to help students become competent and confident communicators in English. Thus, the ELC offers a wide range of free classes and optional tutorials to the entire student body, all year around. Interactive guidance sessions and student-centred teaching approaches stimulate a positive atmosphere where it is okay to make mistakes and where everyone is encouraged to think critically.</p>

<p>Charlie Lockhart, manager of the ELC’s language support services, and the current ELMS coordinator, Gilbert Wong, are more than happy to set up a meeting with me when I tell them about my on-going ELMS essay. They describe ELMS as the flagship of their working environment ‒ as a scheme that stays put when other circumstances change, a scheme that grows larger and more popular for each and every year that passes. </p>

<p>At the moment, 130 students are enrolled together with approximately 35 volunteering mentors. Gilbert says that previous questionnaires have shown great appreciation from almost everyone involved. Students and mentors alike seem to develop into more confident individuals as the scheme comes along. The students improve their English simultaneously as the mentors practice their leadership and coordination skills. The overall key word is communication. On the improvement side, the questionnaires conclude that smaller groups are sometimes preferred, combined with more frequent meetings and additional intergroup activities. Such an intergroup event is actually happening quite soon. All participating ELMS members are invited to a Halloween Party hosted by the ELC by the end of this month. That is something to look forward to.</p>

<p>In terms of financial support from the University, the ELC provides each ELMS group with 1000 HKD to spend on optional activities during the semester. Some restrictive advice on how to use the money comes with the deal. So far, however, my group has enjoyed several sponsored meals and sports activities, which have been very much appreciated. </p>

<p>When I ask Charlie if he has any intent on making changes or alterations to the ELMS program, his smiling response is quite a telling one: “If it isn’t broken, don’t try to fix it”. The truth is that ELMS is a very successful scheme, and both Charlie and Gilbert agree on the continuous importance of up-to-date quality maintenance and out-reaching promotion. But no big game changers are likely to occur in the nearby future - in other words, deliberate business as usual!</p>

<p>From my point of view as a mentor, I find the concept of ELMS very appealing. I highly enjoy hanging out with “my” guys, my new friends. And I am sure I benefit just as much as they do from our regularly meetings, as I constantly gain valuable insights and new aha-moments. Our group of four has formed a great team. We share a number of common interests simultaneously as everyone is keen on contributing with personal favourite activities that might be new to the rest of us. Last week, for example, Antony and Jayden kicked my butt at the badminton court. Today, we had a good discussion about the movie we watched together. Next week Kirk might lead the way hiking to the top of the Lion Rock, and I think they have got plans on taking me to a local restaurant serving chicken feet ‒ huh, that is a new one. I might invite the guys to the ice skating rink in the nearby shopping mall, once it is my turn to host an activity. None of them have ever skated before, but I hope they will accept my “Swedishy” challenge and agree to try it out.</p>

<p>Eating chicken feet might be equally as discomforting for me as ice skating or expressing one’s opinion in English may be for someone else. We all come from different backgrounds and thus, we experience things from various viewpoints. To me, this is what ELMS is all about; it is a scheme, in which we practice on stepping out of our comfort zones. We challenge ourselves, we sometimes even face our fears, and we always help each other out. The more time we spend together, the stronger our confidence grows. And in the meantime, we have fun.</p>

<p>Marie Curie once said: “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”</p>

<p>I am actually looking forward to those spicy chicken joints!</p>
