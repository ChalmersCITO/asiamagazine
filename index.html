        <p>One of Asia’s largest non-governmental organisations, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, has its base of operation in Hualien at Taiwan’s east coast. Its work is to provide relief during disasters – both man-made and natural – and was started in 1966, by the now 73 year old Dharma Master Cheng Yen in the aftermath of the American aid programme coming to an end. Starting out as a monastery for nuns it has since evolved alongside Taiwan’s economic miracle into an organisation with 2 million volunteers worldwide, and an annual income from donations of more than 269 million USD.</p>

I’m just one meter below surface but even so, it takes some minutes before I start to feel comfortable breathing through the regulator. I have been told to breath deep and slow and I do my best to calm down. </p>

        <p>Hong Kong – top five in the categories mathematics and science ever since the first PISA test was launched in 2000. The result speaks for itself and the question is no longer weather Hong Kong is a leading centre for learning mathematics or not, the question is why. An interview with two local students, both studying to become math teachers, will hopefully shed some light on the query.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>In many ways, the rise and fall of Hong Kong as a British colony is a tale of the ever shifting power balance between East and West. When Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 in the wake of the First Opium War, the British Empire was at its height and did truly rule the waves. From a Chinese view, on the other hand, the war marked the beginning of what some call the century of humiliation — a period when China was subjected to the yoke of Western and Japanese imperialism.</p>

        <p>That it’s difficult to find affordable housing in Tokyo is, I would say, a platitude and the reality is more relative to what you’re used to. Coming from Gothenburg, I find homes in Tokyo reasonably priced, however small they may be. Available apartments are abundant, so expats moving in shouldn’t feel overly concerned about difficulties of finding housing. Even so, there can be a lot of reasons why one would like to have immediate short- or medium-term budget options. </p>

        <p>I think that most of us believe that the purpose of going abroad is about embracing new cultures, discover new things, and broaden your horizons. That’s exactly what I thought my trip was going to be like ‒ I was wrong. I’ve always made fun of people travelling to places where there are more Swedes than natives; a trip with all-inclusive, where you are being served continental breakfast and buffet with European food. </p>

        <p>Often referred to as The Little Red Dot, Singapore is a master in the art of multi-cuisine despite its small size. Southeast Asian guidebooks often rank Singaporean food as one of the top experiences in the region. It’s no wonder though; through the history Indian, Chinese, Malay and Indonesian cuisine have mixed into a characteristic Singaporean fusion of delicious delights. Later influences from western cuisine, such as Portuguese and British, also left its marks.</p>
