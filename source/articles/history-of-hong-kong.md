# History of Hong Kong

In many ways, the rise and fall of Hong Kong as a British colony is a tale of the ever shifting power balance between East and West. When Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 in the wake of the First Opium War, the British Empire was at its height and did truly rule the waves. From a Chinese view, on the other hand, the war marked the beginning of what some call the century of humiliation — a period when China was subjected to the yoke of Western and Japanese imperialism. When Hong Kong finally was returned to China in 1997, the situation was radically different. For Britain, the handover was the end of the last major remnant of a long gone empire. For China, it was yet another milestone on the long road back to its lost position as Asia's foremost power.

Whereas the aftermath of the Second World War triggered a rather rapid decolonisation of most imperial possessions, Hong Kong came to stay under the influence of Britain for much longer. Although temporarily ousted by the Japanese, swift action by the British ensured that their rule of Hong Kong resumed immediately following the surrender of Japan. Despite this, it was clear that there would be no return to the pre-war order; Britain was a world power on decline and the 1949 victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War left a fiercely anti-western regime in power of China. The turmoil of civil war and burden of communist dictatorship drove large amount of refugees from the mainland into Hong Kong, rapidly increasing the population. Hong Kong underwent rapid industrialisation in the 1950s, mirroring the later rise of mainland China as a manufacturing giant. In the coming decades, economic development and wide-ranging reforms gave rise to the modern Hong Kong — a global city where the financial sector had replaced manufacturing as the core industry, and where the GDP per capita was as high as the skyscrapers. By the early 80s, it was considered to be one of the four Asians tigers together with Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.

Although Hong Kong finally had found its place among the financial centres and cosmopolitan cities of the world, the question of its future status could not be ignored. While Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula had been ceded to Britain perpetually, the New Territories had been loaned in 1898 for 99 years. This largely rural area made up the majority of the Hong Kong landmass, and the rapid growth of the city necessitated the construction of urban areas and vital infrastructure in the territories. There was no meaningful way to separate this area from the rest, and the future of Hong Kong was thus intimately tied to the fate of the New Territories. In the late 70s the expiration date of the lease, the 1st of July 1997, was only two decades away and concerns about the fate of the city began to mount.

In a partial relief for Hongkongers, the latter half of the 70s also marked significant changes in the Chinese leadership. The death of Mao Zedong put Deng Xiaoping at the helm of China, and far-reaching economical and political reforms followed. Hoping that the new administration would be more amenable in settling the future status of Hong Kong, the British had several meetings with the Chinese in the last years of the decade. From the very start, however, Bejing made it clear that a British Hong Kong beyond 1997 would not be accepted. The talks continued into the 80s and culminated in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The agreement promised that Hong Kong would become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) when transferred to China on the 1st of July 1997, a status it would come to share with the nearby Portuguese colony of Macau. Under the slogan of "one country, two systems", this would mean that Hong Kong would be allowed to keep its legal and economic systems for at least 50 years. The responsibilities of Beijing were to be limited to defence and foreign affairs.

Despite the promises entailed in the declaration, there were naturally many Hongkongers who still treated the intentions of mainland China with suspicion. The violent crushing of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests caused additional fear for the future of the city. When Chris Patten became the last governor of Hong Kong in 1992, he addressed these worries by accelerating the democratic reforms that had begun in the wake of the Sino-British agreement. Up to this point, the territory had freedom of the press and many other liberties associated with the western world, but the average citizen had little direct influence over Hong Kong politics. The original reforms had given the general population the right to elect some seats in Hong Kong's legislative council, but the majority of the seats were in effect chosen by the business elite and other special interest groups. These tended to be heavily pro-stability and thus wary of causing any conflict with the mainland. The 1994 reforms by Patten gave a significantly greater say to the average citizens, an unexpected move that infuriated the Chinese leadership.

The years leading up to 1997 were obviously not free of conflict, but the handover took place as planned. After a ceremony on the evening of the 30th of June, the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China at midnight. The departure of Chris Patten and other British officials that night was both a symbolic end to a once mighty empire and the beginning of a new and uncertain future for Hong Kong. Today, more than 17 years since the handover, it is clear that the worst fears present before the handover did not materialise; the population still enjoys freedoms unheard of in mainland China, and the city remains a major financial centre and the location of choice for many corporate headquarters.

Still, saying that all fears have gone away would be far from the truth. Throughout the entire post-handover period, protests against any government measure perceived as a threat to Hong Kong's way of life have been a regular occurrence. The most recent example is the controversy regarding the upcoming 2017 Chief Executive election. As the position of chief executive replaced that of the British Governor, the planned election would give the people unprecedented power over the Hong Kong government. An August 2014 announcement that only candidates nominated by Beijing would be allowed to stand for the election caused activists to take to the streets in large numbers. In what came to be known as the Umbrella Revolution, key parts of the city were occupied by protesters in late September and early October.

But despite the ongoing conflicts about the future political system of Hong Kong, its most fundamental challenge might lie elsewhere. In a time when China was shut-off from the world, Hong Kong's prosperity was founded on its role as the gateway between East and West. As a result of the economical liberalisation of China, this position can no longer be taken for granted. Therefore, the greatest worry of Hong Kong should perhaps not be that it will be assimilated into the mainland, but rather that its economic system is being replicated by the mainland to the point of Hong Kong becoming redundant.
