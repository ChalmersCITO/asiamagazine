# The Umbrella Movement

### Hong Kong

Thousands of people have gathered in the streets outside the financial and governmental centre in Hong Kong. When the Chinese government announced that they won’t allow civil nominations in the Hong Kong chief executive elections in 2017, some students responded by protesting outside the government headquarters. That was the beginning of the largest demonstrations in China since Tiananmen square in 1989. The protesters started using umbrellas for protection against pepper spray, making it the symbol of the movement. People from all over the city are donating umbrellas, tents and time for the cause – it is no longer only students who are protesting.

"My parents don't like this. They worry about money and having a better life. They want peace, and they don't think this is peace. They think we are causing disturbance and chaos."

### Central

We meet up with Tiffany, one of the protesters, at the central station in Hong Kong. She takes us along the main road through the barricades and into the centre of the protest area. There are things and people everywhere: rows of tents next to blankets to sit on at the street, signs and posters with aphorisms and slogans, works of arts, and of course umbrellas - lots of umbrellas. Tiffany tells us how the protesters have completely overtaken the huge crossway by simply staying there in large numbers. She is herself sleeping there three to five nights a week.

When we ask her what she thinks about the risks she is taking she replies that this area is quite peaceful. It's the smaller protest areas where the streets are narrower that are the most violent. Outside the government headquarters, the main region for the demonstrations, the protesters are to some extent protected by their large numbers. In the smaller regions the police are able to clean up the barricades and move people more easily; hence, these regions are more often subject to clashes between protesters and police. 

Tiffany has been in the front, close to the police forces, several times. "I was there during september 28th when it all started. The eyes of the police are different now.”, she says.  “Before they were calm during the confrontations, now they have crazy eyes. They say that our umbrellas are weapons."

Although a serious undertone, the mood at the demonstration area is quite peaceful and people are keen to help each other. There is no centralized organization, but instead, groups of people take own initiatives and organize stations for handing out supplies such as tents, blankets and food for free. There are also medical tents and a well-equipped public toilet. Tiffany shows us the study area – a place where some people have built wooden benches and desks for students to sit down and study at by the light from small desk lamps during the evenings. 

Later that night we eat dinner with a group of acquaintances from mainland China. When we ask what they think about the demonstrations, they laugh and say that they are the people the protesters are demonstrating against. “The young people don’t know what they are doing. They don’t have a goal and they only cause trouble for ordinary people.“

They all work in the finance district where the main protest area is located; it takes them over one and a half hour extra to get to and from work. One of them tells us that they understand why people are upset, but also emphasises that China is not ready for democracy yet, and that Hong Kong is still a part of China. She says that change will come, but that it has to take its time. 

Everyone we talk to seem to think the protests won’t change the Chinese government's decisions, including the protesters themselves. The people of Hong Kong seem surprised that this is happening; no one expected the demonstrations to carry on for this long, and this is the first time the city has experienced anything similar. One girl tells us that she still believes the demonstrations are important. They serve as a statement to the Chinese government officials that they can’t do whatever they want in Hong Kong without the citizens reacting against it. She says that protests like these are a first step on the way toward a more democratic environment. 

Before we leave, we take a last look at the area. One wall is completely covered with post-it notes with slogans, wishes and messages. On a banner close by, they have cited a worn quote from John Lennon’s Imagine. There is a sense of anticipation in the air; still, the road ahead seems long and winding.
